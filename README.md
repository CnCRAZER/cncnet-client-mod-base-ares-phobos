Thank you for downloading my unofficial mod for C&C Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge - RAZER'S Revenge.

---

To make RAZER'S Revenge work on your computer, follow these instructions:

#1. RAZER'S Revenge is not a standalone mod, but it does not require a game CD to be played.
It requires the following files from C&C Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge, patched to version 1.001:

- BINKW32.dll
- BLOWFISH.dll
- gamemd.exe (patched to version 1.001 - from original CD, The First Decade or The Ultimate Collection release)
- ra2.mix
- ra2md.mix
- language.mix
- langmd.mix

#2. Either extract all the contents of this download to the location
of your Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge installation, or copy the game's directory,
rename it and extract all of the mod archive contents to the copied folder. 

Make sure no other modifications are installed in the directory where RAZER'S Revenge will be.

You can also simply create an empty directory, copy the 7 files listed earlier to it
and extract the contents of RAZER'S Revenge archive to the newly created directory.

The following is advised if you are playing Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge multiplayer on CnCNet:
DO NOT extract RAZER'S Revenge files to the folder where Yuri's Revenge with CnCNet is installed.

#3. Run YRLauncher.exe, configure the settings and play campaign, skirmish or multiplayer on CnCNet.

Enjoy!
